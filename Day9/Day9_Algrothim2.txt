8. I). Write program to set (1) bits CIS, C2OUT, C1OUT in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1 bits are set to 0x06 in register “ADCON0”



1)enter the register
2)Read register “ADCON0”
3) check register “ADCON0” is equal to 0x06
    3.1) if it is equal 
    3.2) read register “CMCON”
    3.3)arrange the 3 7 6 bits of register “CMCON” in the following order
    3.4) and set those bit position
4) print that value
